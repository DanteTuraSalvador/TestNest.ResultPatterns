# 🚀 Result Pattern   

This repository contains an implementation of the **Result pattern** in C#. The Result pattern is a way to handle operations that may fail by returning a `Result<T>` type rather than throwing exceptions. It allows for more expressive error handling and better control over flow without relying on traditional exception handling.

## This implementation includes:

- ✅ **Result class**: Used to wrap success and failure outcomes of operations.
- ✅ **Result<T> class**: A generic version that holds a value and errors for specific operations.
- ✅ **Error class**: Represents detailed error information.
- ✅ **Bind and Map methods**: For fluent chaining and handling asynchronous operations.

## Features

- 🔗 **Fluent Chaining**: Easily chain multiple operations while handling errors cleanly.
- ⚡ **Async Support**: Built-in support for asynchronous operations.
- ⚠️ **Error Handling**: Encapsulates errors with error codes and messages, providing detailed context.
- 🛡️ **Immutability**: Result objects are immutable once created.
